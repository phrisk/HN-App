# HackerNews Application

An unofficial application for Y Combinator's HackerNews written in [JQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/), using [HN-API](https://github.com/sshannon/HN-API).

## About

HN-App is currently in early stages.

Please note I am not affiliated with Y Combinator in any way.

## Dependency

HN-App relies on [HN-API](https://github.com/sshannon/HN-API), as this is not yet hosted online, you must first download and run the server locally. Instructions for doing so can be found on the [HN-API](https://github.com/sshannon/HN-API) Github page. 

Note that you can change the location of the sever in `js/hackernews.js` by modifying the `serverAddress` variable.
